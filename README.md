# Binmatch

A simple crate for binary pattern matching

Check the [Docs](https://docs.rs/binmatch) for examples

# UNMAINTAINED
I currently have no motivation to work on this and improve the API  
I used this for pretty much one project. You can probably use [nom](https://lib.rs/crates/nom) for this
